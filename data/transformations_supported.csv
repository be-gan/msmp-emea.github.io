TransformType,Caller,Explanation
adstockv3,Adstock,Applies a standard adstock transformation to model lagged and decaying media effects.
adstockv4imp,Adstock with rescaled impressions,"Similar to standard adstock but used for impression data, applying rescaling to account for volume."
adr,Ad response,"Applies an advertising response function, typically used for modeling non-linear saturation effects."
lag,Lag,Shifts the variable backward in time to capture delayed effects.
log,Log,Applies a logarithmic transformation to reduce skew and stabilize variance.
ma,Moving average,Smooths the variable by averaging over a specified time window to reduce noise.
abcnew,For diminishing returns,"Applies a functional form tailored for diminishing returns (e.g., sigmoid or Hill-type curves)."
none,No transformation,Leaves the variable untransformed. Use when no preprocessing is required.
customt(),Custom transformation,"Applies a user-defined transformation using a formula-like string. For example, customt(""x^2"") squares the input."""
boxcox,Boxcox,Applies a Box-Cox transformation to stabilize variance and approximate normality.
